# *Sufficient* of Statistics

Statistics is a **problem-solving procedure**:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
subgraph AA["Data"]
    direction TB
    A1@{shape: braces, label: "distribution<br>dependence<br>..."}
end
subgraph BB["Method"]
    direction TB
    B1@{shape: braces, label: "algorithms<br>statistics<br>..."}
end
subgraph CC["Problem"]
    direction TB
    C1@{shape: braces, label: "output<br>metric<br>..."}
end
AA --- BB --- CC
```

## Probability and Statistics

```mermaid
graph LR
A(Data generating process) --Probability--> B(Observed data)
B --Statistical inference--> A
```

[[Probability Theory]] answers the following question:

> [!qn] Given a data generating process, what are the properties of the outcomes?

While statistical inference answers the inverse problem:

> [!qn] Given the outcomes, what can we say about the process that generated the data?
